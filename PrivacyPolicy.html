            Why do you process my personal data?
            
            Personal data collected in connection to the Website and/or the access to the Services
            
            It is quite simple. We collect, store and process the above mentioned personal data in order to allow you an use of the Website and/or the access to the Services.
            
            To comply with legal requirements, we must mention that we collect, store and process such personal data pursuant to Article 6 (1) (b) of the Regulation. That means that processing of such personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract which we concluded – the contract established between you and our company when you access and use the Website and/or attempt to access the Services.
            
            We may collect, store and process such personal data pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) of the Regulation. That means that it is in our legitimate interest to collect, store and process such personal data (even when the contract is terminated), since we have to be able to protect ourselves during the period when you or any third party may contest that we have broken any of our obligations or have violated any applicable laws in relation to the requested issue.
            
            For how long will you process my personal data?
            
            We process and store your personal data only for the time necessary to meet the purposes of its processing specified above, or for the time consented by you, or for the time that is either necessary to comply with our obligations under the applicable law or set forth by the applicable law or in accordance therewith. We comply with the mandatory rules for data archiving.
            
            Once the purpose of the personal data processing disappears, we will destroy the personal data.
            
            Personal data collected in connection to the Website and/or the access to the Services
            
            We will process and store such personal data for the duration of the contract established between you and our company when you use and access the Website and/or access the Services or until an issue requested by you is solved or in case you have created a user account until the account is deleted and also for the subsequent period thereafter that is either necessary to comply with our obligations under the applicable law or set forth by the applicable law or in accordance therewith, or during which you or any third party may contest that we have broken any of our obligations or have violated any applicable laws in relation to the requested issue.
            
            Who will have access to my personal data?
            
            We take care of your personal data security and so we choose the partners to whom we entrust your personal data very carefully. 
            
            All our partners must be able to provide sufficient security of your personal data to prevent unauthorized or accidental access thereto or other abuse thereof and all our partners must undertake a confidentiality obligation and must not use your personal data for any purpose other than the purpose for which the data were made available to them.
            
            The recipients that may have access to your personal data are following:
            
            persons who provide us with the technological services or technology operators that we use to provide our services;
            persons who provide our services and websites with security and integrity and who regularly test such security and integrity;
            providers of accounting, legal and administrative services;
            our staff.
            Our aim is and always will be to ensure your personal data are as anonymous as possible and unavailable to all third parties. However, under certain specifically defined conditions we will be under some circumstances required, in accordance with the applicable law, to transfer certain personal data to public authorities.
            
            When collecting, storing and processing personal data we sometimes may use personal data processors such as Google or Telegram, which under some circumstances transmit your personal data to third countries. In such an event we always make sure such transmission is compliant with the Regulation. In particular, we specify that the personal data may be transmitted to the United States of America and in such event the transmission is compliant with the “Privacy Shield” program.
            
            How are my personal data protected?
            
            All your personal data is secured by standard procedures and technologies using the industry best practice approach. We provide data protection against unauthorized or accidental access, alteration, destruction, loss, unauthorized transmission or any other unauthorized processing, as well as against any other abuse of records containing the personal data.
            
            We are not able to guarantee the security of your personal data without your help and responsible behavior. Therefore, we ask you to help us ensure the security of your data by keeping in secret.

            Please, read our Cookie Policy available on our website to learn more about the cookies that we use.
